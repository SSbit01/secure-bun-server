# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, **please report it privately first**.

### Private Disclosure (Strongly Recommended)

Some forks or deployments of this template may be running in production environments.
To avoid exposing users to unnecessary risk, **do not open a public GitHub issue** for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please contact me directly:

- **Email:** <ss42701@outlook.com>
- **Website:** <https://ssbit01.github.io>

When reporting, please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability.
- Potential impact.
- Any suggested fixes or patches.

You will receive an acknowledgment as soon as possible, and we will work together to verify and address the issue.

### Public Disclosure

After the vulnerability has been fixed, you may publicly disclose the issue if you wish.

### Scope

This policy applies to this repository,
but it does **not** automatically apply to third‑party forks,
although private reporting is still encouraged to avoid harming downstream users.

### Responsible Conduct

Please avoid:

- Running automated scanners that may cause disruption.
- Exploiting vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue.
